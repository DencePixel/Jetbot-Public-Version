# What is Jetbot?

Jetbot is an open-sourced project aimed towards letting users create a custom bot for their own private server. Allowing features such as logging, searching roblox usernames, sending announcement messages through a webhook, letting you read the discord.log file and dm it to the server owner and so much more! This bot is constantly being updated with new commands and new fixes so there is no reason on why not to try it!

# What features does it have?
Logging for channel updates, role updates and member updates. More are coming soon.
Ban and kick command with a customizable reason message for if a user is banned or kicked with no reason provided.
Being able to send announcement messages through a webhook with ease.
Having moderator and admin only commands. 
Being able to search a roblox user through discord.
Being able to display the bots current ping.

# What is coming soon?
In the future we aim to have a bigger development team. Have more commands and make configuration more easy. And also fix part of the logging command as some of it has unexpectedly broke. We also aim to be able to provide better quality commands for our users.

# How do I use Jetbot?
Download all the files from this github page. Then head over to configuration.py , from there you will be able to see documented insturctions on how to set everything up. If you have any issues please navigate to the discord support server, developers will always be happy to help with helping you setup your own instance of Jetbot for your community.

# Can I use my version of Jetbot as a public bot?
Currently, Jetbot is not optimised for being used as a public bot and is meant to be used as a private bot for your own server. Although it may, it is very unlikely Jetbot will ever be able to be used as a public bot just due to the complexity of restructuring everything. But feel free to write and makes changes to your own version of Jetbot if you want to make it a public bot and we will take interest in it!

# How do I configure my version of Jetbot?
Firstly, download all of the files. Then once you have open up a code editor, from there upload the Jetbot file so it takes you to a workspace of the bot. Then navigate to configuration.py, from there you will be able to see everything is documented with what it does and how to set it up if you want it. If you need help setting anything up feel free to join the discord support server!

# What is the difference between the public and private version of Jetbot?
The one you are currently reading, the public version is a easier to configure and more stripped down version of Jetbot public which isn't even released yet. Jetbot public will follow the same structure of not being one bot but letting users put this code onto their own bot, but Jetbot private will be aimed towards being used as a custom bot for bigger servers, giving more management commands and less useless ones.
